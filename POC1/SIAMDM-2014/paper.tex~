%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING STYLE RESTRICTIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%  1. There are no new tags.  Existing LaTeX tags have been formatted to match

%%
%%  2. You must use \cite in the text to mark your reference citations and 
%%     \bibitem in the listing of references at the end of your chapter. See
%%     the examples in the following file. If you are using BibTeX, please
%%     supply the bst file with the manuscript file.

%%
%%  5. No running heads are to be used for this volume.
%% 
%%  6. Theorems, Lemmas, Definitions, etc. are to be double numbered, 
%%     indicating the section and the occurence of that element
%%     within that section. (For example, the first theorem in the second
%%     section would be numbered 2.1. The macro will 
%%     automatically do the numbering for you.
%%
%%  7. Figures, equations, and tables must be single-numbered. 
%%     Use existing LaTeX tags for these elements.
%%     Numbering will be done automatically.

\begin{abstract} \small\baselineskip=9pt 
Information about users in social networks is highly valuable for
understanding user preferences regarding products, brands or politics. Many
works have tried to cluster or classify each user according to her common
interests. This paper, in contrast, proposes an approach to characterize
groups of users with a common interest, expressed through relationships in
social networks. In the characterization process, users preferences are
defined by the semantic topics they most discuss. In order to find semantic
topics, we propose a method that successfully merges topics found through
matrix factorization by performing random walks in a latent-topic transition
graph. Experiments were performed in documents datasets for easier evaluation
and in social network datasets. The method showed to be scalable and accurate
in identifying the semantic topics inside a selected group of users.\\
\textbf{Keywords: users profiles, topic discovery, NMF}
